<h2 id="scope"><a class="header" href="#scope">Scope</a></h2>
<p>This Code of Conduct applies to all Garuda Linux community spaces, including, but not limited to:</p>

<h2 id="community-guidelines"><a class="header" href="#community-guidelines">Community Guidelines</a></h2>
<p>Behaviors that contribute to creating a positive environment include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be friendly.</strong> Use welcoming and inclusive language.</li>
<li><strong>Be empathetic.</strong> Be respectful of others' viewpoints and experiences.</li>
<li><strong>Be respectful.</strong> Express disagreements in a polite and constructive manner.</li>
<li><strong>Be considerate.</strong> Focus on what is best for the community. Keep discussions around technology choices constructive
and respectful. Remember that decisions are often a difficult choice between competing priorities.</li>
<li><strong>Be patient and generous.</strong> If someone asks for help, it is because they need it. When documentation is available
that answers the question, politely point them to it. If the question is off-topic, suggest a more appropriate online
space to seek help.</li>
<li><strong>Try to be concise.</strong> Read the discussion before commenting in order to not repeat a point that has been made.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="inappropriate-behavior"><a class="header" href="#inappropriate-behavior">Inappropriate Behavior</a></h2>
<p>We want all participants in the Garuda Linux community have the best possible experience they can. Community members
asked to stop any inappropriate behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>
<p>Inappropriate behaviors include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Sustained disruption of online discussion, talks, or other events.</strong> Sustained disruption of events, online
discussions, or meetings, including talks and presentations, will not be tolerated. This includes 'Talking over' or '
heckling' event speakers or influencing crowd actions that cause hostility in event sessions. Sustained disruption
also includes drinking alcohol to excess or using recreational drugs to excess, or pushing others to do so.</li>
<li><strong>Harassment of people who don't drink alcohol or other legal substances.</strong> We do not tolerate derogatory comments
about those who abstain from alcohol or other legal substances. We do not tolerate pushing people to drink, talking
about their abstinence or preferences to others, or pressuring them to drink - physically or through jeering.</li>
<li><strong>Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist language or otherwise exclusionary language.</strong> This includes
deliberately referring to someone by a gender that they do not identify with, and/or questioning the legitimacy of an
individual's gender identity. If you're unsure if a word is derogatory, don't use it. This also includes repeated
subtle and/or indirect discrimination.</li>
<li><strong>Unwelcome sexual attention or behavior that contributes to a sexualized environment.</strong> This includes sexualized
comments, jokes or imagery in interactions, communications or presentation materials, as well as inappropriate
touching, groping, or sexual advances. Sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material.
Meetup organizing staff and other volunteer organizers should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or
otherwise create a sexualized environment.</li>
<li><strong>Unwelcome physical contact.</strong> This includes touching a person without permission, including sensitive areas such as
their hair, pregnant stomach, mobility device (wheelchair, scooter, etc) or tattoos. This also includes physically
blocking or intimidating another person. Physical contact without affirmative consent is not acceptable. This includes
sharing or distribution of sexualized images or text.</li>
<li><strong>Violence or threats of violence.</strong> Violence and threats of violence are not acceptable - online or offline. This
includes incitement of violence toward any individual, including encouraging a person to commit self-harm. This also
includes posting or threatening to post other people's personally identifying information ("doxxing") online.</li>
<li><strong>Influencing or encouraging inappropriate behavior.</strong> If you influence or encourage another person to violate the
Code of Conduct, you may face the same consequences as if you had violated the Code of Conduct.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="safety-versus-comfort"><a class="header" href="#safety-versus-comfort">Safety versus Comfort</a></h3>
<p>The Garuda Linux community prioritizes marginalized people's safety over privileged people's comfort. The following are
not against the Code of Conduct.</p>
<ul>
<li>"Reverse"-isms, including "reverse racism," "reverse sexism," and "cisphobia"</li>
<li>Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as "leave me alone," "go away," or "I'm not discussing this with you."</li>
<li>Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions</li>
<li>Communicating boundaries or criticizing oppressive behavior in a "tone" you don't find congenial</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have questions about the above statements, please
read <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Foundation/CodeOfConduct/SupportingDiversity">GNOME Foundation's document on Supporting Diversity</a>.</p>
<p>Outreach and diversity efforts directed at under-represented groups are permitted under the code of conduct. For
example, a social event for women would not be classified as being outside the Code of Conduct under this provision.</p>
<p>Basic expectations for conduct are not covered by the "reverse-ism clause" and would be enforced irrespective of the
demographics of those involved. For example, racial discrimination will not be tolerated, irrespective of the race of
those involved. Nor would unwanted sexual attention be tolerated, whatever someone's gender or sexual orientation.
Members of our community have the right to expect that participants in the project will uphold these standards.</p>
<p>If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, the Garuda Linux's staff may take any action
they deem appropriate. In cases involving the staff or founding members the immediate action is expelishment.</p>

<p>Behaviors that contribute to creating a positive environment include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be friendly.</strong> Use welcoming and inclusive language.</li>
<li><strong>Be empathetic.</strong> Be respectful of others' viewpoints and experiences.</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="safety-versus-comfort-1"><a class="header" href="#safety-versus-comfort-1">Safety versus Comfort</a></h3>
<p>The Garuda Linux community prioritizes marginalized people's safety over privileged people's comfort. The following are
not against the Code of Conduct.</p>
<ul>
<li>"Reverse"-isms, including "reverse racism," "reverse sexism," and "cisphobia"</li>
<li>Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as "leave me alone," "go away," or "I'm not discussing this with you."</li>
<li>Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions</li>
<li>Communicating boundaries or criticizing oppressive behavior in a "tone" you don't find congenial</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have questions about the above statements, please
read <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Foundation/CodeOfConduct/SupportingDiversity">GNOME Foundation's document on Supporting Diversity</a>.</p>
<p>Outreach and diversity efforts directed at under-represented groups are permitted under the code of conduct. For
example, a social event for women would not be classified as being outside the Code of Conduct under this provision.</p>
<p>Basic expectations for conduct are not covered by the "reverse-ism clause" and would be enforced irrespective of the
demographics of those involved. For example, racial discrimination will not be tolerated, irrespective of the race of
those involved. Nor would unwanted sexual attention be tolerated, whatever someone's gender or sexual orientation.
Members of our community have the right to expect that participants in the project will uphold these standards.</p>
<p>If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, the Garuda Linux's staff may take any action
they deem appropriate. In cases involving the staff or founding members the immediate action is expelishment.</p>
